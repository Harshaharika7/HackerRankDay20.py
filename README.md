## 📘 Day 20: Sorting | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This repository contains the Python solution for Day 20 of the HackerRank 30 Days of Code challenge, focused on implementing and analyzing the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

-Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order.

-Track the total number of swaps performed during sorting.

-Output the number of swaps, the first element, and the last element of the sorted array.

## 📝 Problem Statement

-Complete the program to:

-Perform bubble sort on the input array.

-Print the number of swaps made during sorting.

-Print the first and last elements of the sorted array.

## ✅ Constraints

      2 ≤ n ≤ 600
      
      1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 2 × 10⁶

## 🔢 Sample Input

      3  
      
      3 2 1

## ✅ Sample Output

      Array is sorted in 3 swaps.
      
      First Element: 1 
      
      Last Element: 3

## 💡 Explanation

      -The array [3, 2, 1] is sorted using bubble sort.
      
      -The algorithm performs 3 swaps to completely sort the array.
      
      -The sorted array is [1, 2, 3].

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

-Bubble Sort algorithm

-Loop control and swap counting

-In-place array modification

-Time complexity awareness

-Clean output formatting and validation

## 🛠 How to Run

Option 1: With input file

Create a file named input.txt with the input values and run:

        python3 sorting_bubble.py < input.txt

Option 2: Manual input

        python3 sorting_bubble.py

Then enter the input manually.
